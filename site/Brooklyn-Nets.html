	<h1>History of the Brooklyn Nets</h1>
	<div>
		<p>Brooklyn Nets, American professional basketball team based in Brooklyn, New York, that plays in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association (NBA). As a member of the American Basketball Association (ABA), the Nets won two championships (1974, 1976).</p>
		<p> The franchise was founded in 1967 and was known as the New Jersey Americans during its first season. The team began playing its home games on Long Island in the 1968–69 season, which led the team to change its name to the New York Nets. While they advanced to the ABA finals in 1971–72, the Nets failed to finish higher than third place in any of their first six seasons.

</p>
<p>In 1973 the team traded for superstar forward Julius Erving, who instantly turned the franchise around and led it to a 25-win improvement on its previous season in his first year in New York. The Nets won the ABA title that season, and Erving led the team to a second championship in 1975–76. When the ABA merged with the NBA in 1976, the Nets were forced to raise $8 million in order to join the established league. Lacking many viable assets, the team sold Erving to the Philadelphia 76ers, and its fortunes quickly turned for the worse: the team had five straight losing seasons upon joining the NBA (though they did qualify for the playoffs in 1979 with a 37–45 record).</p>
